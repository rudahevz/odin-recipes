    <h1>Crispy Garlic Breadcrumb Chicken</h1>

    <p></p>
    <p>While not identical to a pan-fried, breaded cutlet, if you want to eat tender, flavorful chicken with lots of crispy, crunchy bits, then this significantly less-messy method is for you.</p> 
    <p>One of the keys to this technique is to use panko breadcrumbs, which are much larger and more jagged than regular, fine breadcrumbs. This method also allows us to introduce </p>
    <p>some additional flavor, and moisture, thanks to the 'glue' we use to attach the crumbs. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts </li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>cayenne pepper to taste </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>For the Garlic Breadcrumbs:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter </li>
        <li>½ cup panko bread crumbs </li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, finely crushed </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped Italian parsley </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>For the 'Glue':</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar </li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons Dijon mustard </li>
        <li>¼ cup chicken broth </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>For the Optional Pan Sauce:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup chicken broth </li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar </li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
        <p>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt, black pepper, and cayenne.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
        <p>Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over high heat. Add chicken breasts. Sear, untouched, until bottoms release from the pan, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook for 2 minutes more.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
        <p>Reduce heat to medium-low. Add butter and let melt. Add panko bread crumbs. Cook and stir until breadcrumbs start to turn golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until </p>
        <p>fragrant, about 1 minute. Turn off heat and add parsley and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Set breading aside.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
        <p>Combine mayonnaise, balsamic vinegar, and Dijon mustard in a small bowl. Spread 'glue' over the top and sides of the chicken breasts. Spoon over the the breadcrumb mixture. </p> 
        <p>a spatula to transfer chicken breasts back to the skillet. Pour chicken broth around the chicken.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </p>
        <p>Transfer chicken to a plate and let rest while you make the pan sauce.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 7</strong></li>
        <p>Pour chicken broth and lemon juice into the pan. Bring to a boil over high heat and add balsamic vinegar. Boil until sauce is reduced, about 2 minutes. Strain sauce and spoon around chicken.</p>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <h1>Chef's Notes: </h1>
    <p>If you can't find panko, you can easily make you own breadcrumbs. Just pulse chunks of stale white bread in a food processor until coarsely ground, </p>
    <p>and then spread out on a baking sheet, and place in a 275 degree F (135 degree C) oven until they are dried and crispy.</p>
    <p>Customize the 'glue' with any herbs or spices you like.</p>
